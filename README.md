PhD student double majoring in Biochem and Mol Bio and Environmental Tox at Michigan State University in the Zacharewski lab. 

B.S. in 2019 from Grand Valley State University in Cell and Molecular Biology. 

Not a programmer, but I program. (Cue: "If you build it, they will come.")

If you ever want to use anything I have for a publication, I would appreciate you letting me know.
